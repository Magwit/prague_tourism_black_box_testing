# Prague Tourism Black Box Testing

## Learning Selenium and pytest by testing the official tourist website for Prague

This project is made just to practice Selenium and pytest on the [prague.eu](https://www.prague.eu/en) site.
Compared with the first project the intention is to make progress on the following points: 

- More deliberate use of pytest fixtures 
- Moving away from implicit waits to explicit waits
- Wiser use of web element locators
