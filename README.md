# Prague Tourism Black Box Testing

## Learning Selenium and pytest by testing the official tourist website for Prague

This project is made just to practice Selenium and pytest on a site. 
Compared with the first project the intention is to make progress on the following points: 
 
- more deliberate use of pytest fixture 
- moving away from implicit waits to explicit waits
- wiser use of web element locators
